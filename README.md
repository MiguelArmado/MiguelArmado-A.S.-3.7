# MiguelArmado-A.S.-3.7
This is a GitHub repository containing versions of my program for my 3.7 A.S. Foreign Exchange utilising GUI

This program will perform the simple process of calculating and converting amounts of currencies and allowing the user to export the conversions to a .txt file.
I will be using an API to help me make this program possible and by doing that, it will make my program more flexible and will calculate conversions using
real-time currency conversions.

The libraries that are required for my program to run are the requests, json, and tkinter library. I used requests in order for me to get information from websites using URL. I used json to manipulate the said information from a website which is in a form of a .json file. Lastly, I used tkinter in order to create a GUI for my program.
